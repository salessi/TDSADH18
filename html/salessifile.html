<br>Work of refitting the Gracie
<br>Mansion, historic manor house in 
<br>Carl Schurz Park, as an official
<br>residence of the city’s mayors is 
<br>progressing despite priorities on 
<br>construction materials and lack of 
<br>adequate appropriations. The house
<br>will be ready to receive Mayor La 
<br>Guardia and his family “well be-
<br>fore Summer arrives,” it was dis-
<br>closed yesterday.

<br>A WPA crew of laborers began 
<br>renovation of the 142-year-old
<br>frame dwelling and part of the 
<br>ground of the thirteen and a half 
<br>acres on Jan. 22. The job was
<br>scheduled to take three months,
<br>but delays in obtaining metals held
<br>up the work. Difficulties in get-
<br>ting fundamental items for the in-
<br>terior decoration plan also have
<br>been overcome recently, a spokes-
<br>man for the Department of Parks,
<br>in charge of the project, said yes-
<br>terday.

**Comfort Station Removed**

<br>The public comfort station has
<br>been removed from the basement
<br>of the three-story house and a new
<br>station is being completed at a
<br>cost of $8,000 for park visitors 300
<br>feet south of the mansion. The 
<br>residence stands at the north end
<br>of the park near East River
<br>Drive opposite Eighty-eighth Street, 
<br>overlooking Hells Gate. In the base-
<br>ment, which is partly above the 
<br>ground level, four servants’ rooms,
<br>a room for the Mayor’s police 
<br>guard and an office for the park 
<br>supervisor are being made.

 <br>On the first floor the large cen-
<br>tral hall off the main entrance
<br>facing the East River, the living
<br>room, dining room and library have
<br>not been change. The curator’s
<br>office (the mansion was maintained
<br>as a public museum from 1927 until 
<br>last January) has been converted 
<br>into a modern kitchen, and part of 
<br>the side porch adjoining the kitchen
<br>has been altered for a servant’s sit-
<br>ting room. A pantry, joining kitch-
<br>en and dining room, has been pro-
<br>vided. A driveway has been laid 
<br>from Eighty-Sixth Street to the
<br>north side of the house, where an 
<br>entrance has been cut and a stair-
<br>case installed.

 <br>The caretaker’s apartment on
<br>the north side of the second story
<br>has been ripped out. A master 
<br>bedroom, with four windows and a
<br>large bath and dressing alcove, has
<br>been fitted into the northeast cor-
<br>ner. A former bedroom in the
<br>center of an eastern exposure has
<br>been altered to a sitting room, 
<br>while three more bedrooms each 
<br>with a private bath lined with mar-
<br>ble, have been set into the other
<br>corners of the second floor. The 
<br>size of these bathrooms can be 
<br>judged from the fact that one of
<br>them was originally a child’s bed 
<br>chamber.

<br>The attic will be left as unfin-
<br>ished storage space. The spacious 
<br>double veranda running around
<br>three sides of the house and the 
<br>open fireplaces that are virtual-
<br>ly in every room likewise will remain. 
<br>When the Department of Parks re-
<br>paired the building in 1934, the
<br>central heating and electric sys-
<br>tems were installed. New radia-
<br>tors and electric outlets are being
<br>added now. An iron fence will sep-
<br>arate the residence and “yard” 
<br>from the remainder of the park. 

**Embury the Architect**

<br>Plans for conversion of the build-
<br>ing and decoration of the interior 
<br>were drawn by Aymar Embury 2d, 
<br>consulting architect to the Depart-
<br>ment of Parks. The rooms are to
<br>be furnished in the fashion of 1800, 
<br>when the house was built by Archi-
<br>bald Gracie, owner of the famous 
<br>fleet of clipper ships, with “perma-
<br>nent loans” of authentic pieces in 
<br>the period of duncan Phyfe from 
<br>the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 
<br>the Brooklyn Museum and the 
<br>Museum of the City of New York.

<br>Selection for the pieces, however, 
<br>could not proceed until the basic 
<br>items of the scheme, such as rugs, 
<br>draperies, wall coverings and new 
<br>upholstery fabrics for the antiques, 
<br>were obtained. The museums could 
<br>not donate these articles for actual 
<br>daily use and the Board of Esti-
<br>mate had refused to appropriate 
<br>$5,000 for them. Private donors,
<br>however, have promised to provide 
<br>them, it was said yesterday. The 
<br>Mayor, with his wife, two children
<br>and a small nephew who lives with
<br>him, may be able to leave their 
<br>apartment at 1274 Fifth Avenue
<br>for the housewarming in Gracie 
<br>Mansion next moth.
